# Exploring COVID data from  Our World in Data

Using data from Our World in Data, I explored the impact of COVID and vaccination progress on the country, continent, and worldwide-level by writing SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server (see [file](https://github.com/kimberlytanyh/SQL_Exploring_COVIDdata/blob/main/WalkThroughPortfolio1.sql)). Outputs are used for creating a Tableau dashboard.

Excel files above contain the outputs from SQL queries in the SQL Server file attached. Using these files, I created a Tableau story.
